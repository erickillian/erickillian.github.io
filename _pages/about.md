Hi, I'm Eric Killian! I'm an embedded software engineer working on new developments in space robotics.

I have a deep passion for machine learning and robotic systems, fields that fascinate me for their potential to solve complex problems through innovative approaches. Beyond the technical details, I am driven by the opportunity to explore how these technologies can make a tangible difference in everyday life.

When Iâ€™m not working on cutting-edge robotics or learning about the latest in AI, you can find me cheering for Ohio State football, enjoying the outdoors, or tinkering with personal projects. Feel free to connect with me through the social links below!
