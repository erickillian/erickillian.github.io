For my senior capstone project, me and a team of three others chose
to make an electronic cleaning dispensor (in the spirit of Covid-19). It featured four DC pumps, an LED screen, a keypad
a cleaning supply tank, and a custom 3D modeled dispense nozzle. The prototype was capabile of dispensing
cleaning supplies with programmable mililiter amounts for various cleaning applications.
