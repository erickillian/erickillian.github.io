This project was the first team project I worked on my freshman year as an Engineer at Ohio State. The goal was to build the most efficient propeller based vehicle that would ride along a rail system.

The project featured a battery, an Arduino microcontroller, and 2 propellers as well as some components for the vehicle body. My team ran tests to determine optimal battery placement and propeller width for the vehicle.

Myself and three other students came up with a design to compete against other students. This involved techical design, budgeting, and teamwork and was a great introduction for me in the field of Engineering.
